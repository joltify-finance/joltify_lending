# End-Block

At each EndBlock, redemption requests that have matured are automatically processed, resulting in the insurance pool token for the redemption being burned and the pro-rata quote currency amount corresponding to the redemption being withdrawn from the insurance module to the underwriter's balances. More details can be found in the in Automatic withdrawal of pending redemptions in the [state transitions](./02_state_transitions.md) section.
